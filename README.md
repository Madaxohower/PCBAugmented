# PCBAugmented
This project showcases a 3D Augmented Reality (AR) overlay that allows users to visualize the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout in real-time through an AR interface.

# 3D Augmented Reality PCB Overlay Using Arduino as a Reference

## Description
This project uses **Augmented Reality (AR)** to visualize a **PCB layout** in 3D, with an **Arduino board** serving as the reference object. The application detects the physical Arduino board and overlays the corresponding PCB design onto it, enabling real-time, interactive exploration of the PCB components.

## Features
- **Real-Time 3D Visualization**: 
- **Arduino Board Detection**: 
- **Interactive Exploration**:
- **Simple Setup**:

## Technologies Used
- OBJ file
- Arduino (for physical reference)
- OpenCV
- Python

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
3. Install Python Interpreter.
4. Use the Arduino board as the reference for visualizing the 3D PCB.
5. Run the app to see the AR overlay.
